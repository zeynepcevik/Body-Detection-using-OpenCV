# Full Body Detection using OpenCV

This project detects human bodies in videos using the OpenCV library and Haar cascade classifiers. It applies image processing techniques to analyze each frame of the video and identifies human bodies by enclosing them in bounding boxes. Haar cascade classifiers are trained on pre-defined patterns to recognize typical features of human bodies, such as body shape, facial features, and other distinctive characteristics. The OpenCV library processes the images using these classifiers and detects human bodies. As a result, the project provides a reliable method for detecting human bodies and can be used in various application areas.
